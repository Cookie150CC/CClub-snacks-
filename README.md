# introduction
We are making a new  concessions/snack system for the club. The programing language we have decided on is python. To make the user interface, we use a framework called PYQT5 which is a subset of QT which is a set of markup libraries to make interfaces.
## installing Python
The first thing you need is python 3. To install python 3, download from [this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are on a terminal based operating system like linux or Mac open a terminal and type `brew install python3` on Mac or `sudo apt-get install python3.7` for ubuntu.
## installing PYQT5
Now that you have python, there is another important thing you need to run this project. To get PYQT5 on windows, download from [the following link](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5). On Mac and linux, either do `brew install pyqt5` on mac  or `sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5` for linux. 
## building the project
Next, clone the repository by doing the following command git clone https://github.com/ccowmu/CClub-snacks-.git. Next, navigate to the directory you put the repository in and do the following command to build `python snack_ui.py`. You know you built the app when you see a new window show up and see the UI onscreen.
